# ZoidBox

An IRC bot that (attempts to) bring the knowledge and wit of @boyzoid to ##coldfusion on freenode.

Pull requests welcome!

## Documentation

Run `#help` in a chat room with zoidbox to be sent a link to the [documentation](https://github.com/atuttle/zoidbox/blob/master/help.md). There's also [ops documentation](https://github.com/atuttle/zoidbox/blob/master/opshelp.md).

## Pull Requests Encouraged!

Please create your additions in the form of a plugin: a `.js` file in the `plugins/` folder. Look at other plugins for examples of how to design them.

Please use jshint! Again, examples of relevant jshint options can be found in the existing plugins.
